## Project Notes

## OpenVine Video Feed Loading - No More Gate Blocking

**Date**: 2025-10-25

**Files Modified**:
- lib/providers/video_events_providers.dart - Removed appReady gate blocking
- lib/providers/readiness_gate_providers.dart - Made NostrInitialization keepAlive
- lib/services/nostr_service_direct_web.dart - Added onInitialized callback support

**Key Commit**: "fix(feeds): remove gate blocking from videoEventsProvider to enable database-first loading"

**What Was Wrong**:
- Popular Now and Trending tabs showed "No videos" despite 900+ cached videos in database
- videoEventsProvider was checking `if (isAppReady && isTabActive)` before starting subscription
- When nostrReady was false (common after hot restart), it returned empty list

**What Was Fixed**:
- videoEventsProvider now ALWAYS calls _startSubscription() regardless of gates
- VideoEventService handles Nostr readiness internally with queueing
- Cache-first strategy now works correctly - shows cached videos immediately

**Verified Clean**:
- Checked all other feed providers (home, hashtag, profile) - none have gate blocking
- All feeds use VideoEventService which has built-in cache-first strategy
- Architecture is now consistent across all feed types

**Next Steps**:
- User needs to test that Popular Now and Trending tabs now show videos
- Consider if NostrService init can be optimized (currently takes a while)
