## Project Notes

Feature flag system had incomplete refactoring - service removed ChangeNotifier but providers still needed reactivity. Tests were failing because flag changes weren't triggering UI updates. Root cause: provider read service.currentState.allFlags once but never got notified of changes. Solution: Re-added ChangeNotifier to service and proper listener setup in provider.
