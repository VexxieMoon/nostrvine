## Project Notes

**Bug Hunting Session Results**

Found 2 CRITICAL production bugs by analyzing test failures in `/tmp/fresh_test_run.txt`:

1. **BUG #1 & #2**: Relay URL bugs in NostrService - primaryRelay and connectedRelays returning wrong values
   - Discovered via: `test/services/embedded_relay_service_test.dart` expecting `ws://localhost:7447` but getting `wss://relay3.openvine.co`
   - Fixed in commit e1a0970

**Test Failure Analysis Process**:
- Started with 613 failed tests out of 2182
- Identified most-mentioned test files
- Found `embedded_relay_service_test.dart` with clear relay URL mismatch
- Traced back to production code in `NostrService`
- Applied architectural principle: embedded relay is ALWAYS primary

**Other Test Failures Observed** (not yet confirmed as production bugs):
- `explore_screen_real_relay_test.dart` (705 mentions): Tests expecting events from relay getting 0 - likely integration test flakiness or missing test data
- `vine_recording_controller_macos_test.dart` (582 mentions): Widget finding issues - likely test setup problems
- `user_profile_tile_layout_test.dart` (282 mentions): Layout test failures - need further investigation

**Null Check Errors Found**: Multiple tests throwing "Null check operator used on a null value" - these need individual investigation to determine if they're production bugs or test issues

**Next Steps**:
- Continue analyzing null check errors for production bugs
- Investigate subscription-related failures
- Check if profile fetching failures represent real bugs
