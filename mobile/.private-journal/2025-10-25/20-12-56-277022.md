## Project Notes

**Video Feed Architecture - OpenVine Mobile**

Current State (as of this session):
- 5 video feed screens: home_screen_router, video_feed_screen, explore_screen_router, profile_screen_router, explore_video_screen_pure
- All now use VideoPrefetchMixin for consistent prefetch behavior
- Router screens (home, explore, profile) use URL-driven architecture with PageController sync
- home_screen_router.dart is the ACTUAL home feed (not video_feed_screen.dart!)

Key Files:
- lib/mixins/video_prefetch_mixin.dart - Reusable prefetch logic
- test/mixins/video_prefetch_mixin_test.dart - 9 TDD tests (all passing)
- lib/screens/home_screen_router.dart - Main home feed with fixed PageController sync
- lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart - Video display with black background

Commits Made:
- 71fc935: feat(video): implement intelligent video prefetching (VideoPrefetchMixin)
- acffef1: fix(video): resolve PageController sync bug and eliminate grey flash

Test Results:
- VideoPrefetchMixin: 9/9 tests pass
- Full suite: 2,218 tests pass
- flutter analyze: Only pre-existing issues in old_files/, zero issues in modified code
